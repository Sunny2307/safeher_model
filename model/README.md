   python test_deployment.py http://localhost:5000
   ```

### Deployment

1. **Choose a platform** (Render recommended for free tier)
2. **Run the deployment script:**
   ```bash
   ./deploy.sh
   ```
3. **Follow the platform-specific instructions**

## Stress Categories

The API analyzes stress across multiple categories:

### Universal Categories (All Roles)
- **Emotional Well-being**: Overall emotional state
- **Safety**: Sense of security and comfort
- **Confidence**: Self-esteem and self-assurance
- **Social Support**: Relationships and community
- **Time Management**: Organization and planning

### Role-Specific Categories
- **Students**: Academic pressure, peer stress, parental expectations
- **Working Women**: Career growth, work-life balance, job workload
- **Housewives**: Domestic workload, recognition, financial dependency

## Stress Levels

- **Low Stress** (0-16 points): Minimal stress indicators
- **Medium Stress** (17-27 points): Moderate stress levels  
- **High Stress** (28-40 points): High stress indicators

## Integration with Frontend

After deployment, update your React Native app:

```javascript
// In frontend/src/services/stressService.js
const STRESS_API_BASE_URL = 'https://your-deployed-model-url.com';
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Import errors**: Make sure all dependencies are installed
2. **File not found**: Ensure all CSV files are in the datasets folder
3. **CORS errors**: Flask-CORS is configured for common origins
4. **Deployment fails**: Check that all files are committed to Git

### Debug Steps

1. Test locally first: `python app.py`
2. Check logs in your deployment platform
3. Use the test script: `python test_deployment.py <URL>`
4. Verify all datasets are present

## Contributing

1. Test changes locally
2. Update tests if needed
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Test with the mobile app
5. Deploy to production

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check the troubleshooting section
2. Review deployment logs
3. Test endpoints individually
4. Contact the development team
